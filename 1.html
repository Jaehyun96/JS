    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
    Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging
    webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers
    can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website
    semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming
    language.</p>

    <p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be
    used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
    semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
